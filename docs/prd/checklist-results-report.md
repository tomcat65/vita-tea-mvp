## Top Issues by Priority

**BLOCKERS**: None identified

**HIGH**:
- Data migration strategy not explicitly defined for potential platform pivot scenario
- Specific technical trade-offs not fully documented (Firebase vs alternatives)

**MEDIUM**:
- UI component library specifics could be expanded
- Integration testing approach for third-party services needs more detail

**LOW**:
- Additional diagrams would enhance understanding
- More examples in acceptance criteria would help developers

## MVP Scope Assessment

**Scope Analysis**: The MVP is appropriately scoped with 4 focused epics delivering incremental value. The 3-product catalog approach validates market demand without overengineering.

**Features Appropriately Included**:
- Core ecommerce functionality (cart, checkout, payments)
- Essential inventory and fulfillment workflows
- Critical analytics for validation metrics
- Educational content supporting differentiation

**Features Correctly Excluded**:
- AI agent system (post-MVP)
- Subscription functionality (post-MVP)
- Advanced personalization (post-MVP)
- Multi-language support (post-MVP)

## Technical Readiness

**Clarity of Technical Constraints**: Well-defined Firebase constraints with specific quotas and limitations identified.

**Identified Technical Risks**: Comprehensive risk analysis completed with mitigation strategies including parallel Shopify development.

**Areas Needing Architect Investigation**:
- Firestore transaction design for inventory concurrency
- Firebase Functions optimal structure for payment webhooks
- CDN configuration for product image optimization

## Recommendations

1. **Document data export procedures** in more detail for the identified platform pivot risk
2. **Add specific rationale** for choosing Firebase over headless commerce alternatives
3. **Expand integration test scenarios** for Stripe webhook handling
4. **Consider adding system architecture diagram** in architect handoff
5. **Define specific performance benchmarks** for mobile commerce optimization

## Final Decision

âœ… **READY FOR ARCHITECT**: The PRD and epics are comprehensive, properly structured, and ready for architectural design. The minor gaps identified can be addressed during the architecture phase without blocking progress.
