# Next Steps

## UX Expert Prompt

Please review this Product Requirements Document (PRD) for the Vita-Tea MVP ecommerce platform and create a comprehensive UI/UX design system that brings the wellness tea brand to life. Focus on translating the functional requirements into intuitive user interfaces that emphasize educational content, premium positioning, and seamless mobile commerce experiences aligned with our WCAG AA accessibility targets.

## Architect Prompt

Using this PRD as your foundation, please create a detailed technical architecture document for the Vita-Tea MVP platform. Focus on designing a scalable Firebase-powered serverless architecture that supports the functional requirements while staying within free tier limits during MVP validation. Address the identified technical risks with specific mitigation strategies and ensure the architecture can evolve to support the post-MVP vision of AI agents and subscription services.
