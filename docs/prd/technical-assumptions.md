# Technical Assumptions

## Repository Structure: Monorepo

Single Firebase project repository containing frontend React application, Firebase Functions backend services, and shared configuration. Separate environments (dev/staging/prod) within unified codebase for streamlined deployment and maintenance.

## Service Architecture

**Serverless Microservices within Firebase Ecosystem**: Firebase Functions handle payment processing, inventory management, and order fulfillment as discrete serverless functions. Frontend React application connects to Firestore for real-time data synchronization and Firebase Authentication for user management.

**Risk Mitigation**: Firebase Premium Support tier established before launch, comprehensive monitoring for quota limits, and documented rollback procedures to Shopify if complexity outweighs benefits.

## Testing Requirements

**Unit + Integration Testing**: Jest unit tests for React components and Firebase Functions, Cypress integration testing for critical ecommerce flows (checkout, authentication, order processing). Manual testing protocols for payment processing and order fulfillment workflows.

**Enhanced Testing**: Load testing for Black Friday scenarios, Firestore transaction testing for inventory concurrency, and webhook reliability testing for payment processing edge cases.

## Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests

**Frontend Technology Stack:**

- **React 18** with TypeScript for type safety and developer experience
- **Next.js** with Static Site Generation for SEO optimization and Firebase Hosting routing optimization
- **shadcn/ui** component library for consistent design system implementation
- **Framer Motion** for compelling interactions and micro-animations
- **Tailwind CSS** for responsive design and rapid styling

**Backend Services:**

- **Firebase Firestore** with proper transaction design for inventory consistency and quota monitoring
- **Firebase Functions** for serverless backend logic with retry mechanisms and error handling
- **Firebase Authentication** supporting email/password, Google, and Apple sign-in
- **Firebase Hosting** with CDN, SSL auto-management, and performance monitoring

**Third-Party Integrations:**

- **Stripe** with comprehensive webhook handling, failed payment retry logic, and chargeback workflows
- **Google Analytics 4** integrated with Firebase Analytics for comprehensive tracking
- **Mailchimp** API integration with rate limiting handling and GDPR-compliant sync protocols

**Risk Mitigation Strategies:**

- **Parallel Shopify Development**: Complete backup store setup during Firebase development as insurance policy
- **Knowledge Transfer Requirements**: All contractor work must include comprehensive documentation and internal team training
- **Compliance Framework**: FDA/FTC health claims compliance logging and content moderation tools implementation
- **Data Export Procedures**: Structured customer data export protocols for potential platform migration

**Development and Deployment:**

- **Firebase CLI** for local development and deployment automation
- **GitHub Actions** CI/CD pipeline with Firebase quota monitoring and automated alerts
- **ESLint + Prettier** for code quality and consistency standards
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Performance alerts, quota limit warnings, and business continuity dashboards

**Post-MVP Architectural Considerations:**

- **AI Agent Infrastructure**: Conversation state management and real-time chat architecture planning
- **Subscription Service Design**: Complex billing logic state machines and dunning management preparation
- **Scalability Planning**: Auto-scaling strategies and enterprise Firebase capabilities roadmap
