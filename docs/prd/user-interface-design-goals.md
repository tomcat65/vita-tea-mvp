# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision
Modern, wellness-focused ecommerce experience emphasizing educational content and premium positioning. Clean, trustworthy design that builds confidence in functional health benefits while maintaining accessibility for health-conscious consumers aged 25-55. The interface should feel like a premium tea shop with knowledgeable staff rather than a generic ecommerce platform.

## Key Interaction Paradigms
- **Educational-first browsing**: Product discovery through health benefits and ingredient education rather than traditional category filtering
- **Gentle guidance approach**: Optional AI assistance that appears contextually without overwhelming users who prefer traditional browsing
- **Trust-building interactions**: Transparent ingredient sourcing, organic certifications, and scientific backing prominently displayed
- **Seamless mobile commerce**: Touch-optimized checkout with digital wallet integration for quick mobile purchases

## Core Screens and Views
- **Dual-Entry Homepage**: Traditional navigation (Shop by Type/Benefit/Gift) with optional "Meet our tea experts" AI guidance entry point
- **Product Detail Pages**: Rich ingredient information, health benefits, brewing instructions, and educational content
- **Shopping Cart & Checkout**: Streamlined flow with guest checkout option and digital wallet integration
- **Customer Dashboard**: Order history, preferences, and personalized recommendations
- **Educational Content Hub**: Brewing guides, ingredient benefits, and wellness articles

## Accessibility: WCAG AA
Target WCAG AA compliance to ensure inclusive experience for users with disabilities, supporting screen readers, keyboard navigation, and color contrast requirements for health-conscious demographic.

## Branding
Premium wellness aesthetic combining clean modern design with natural, organic elements. Warm earth tones and botanical imagery that convey trust, quality, and health benefits. Typography should be highly readable with clear hierarchy supporting educational content consumption.

## Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive
Mobile-first responsive design optimizing for iPhone/Android browsing and purchasing, with enhanced desktop experience for educational content consumption. Progressive web app capabilities for improved mobile performance.
