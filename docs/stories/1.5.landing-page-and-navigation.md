## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

From Story 1.4 (Product Catalog Display System):
- Successfully implemented Web Components pattern with Shadow DOM for reusable UI elements
- Alpine.js store pattern established for state management
- Analytics service implemented with Cloud Function for tracking events
- Firebase service singleton pattern established with proper initialization
- Manual testing approach confirmed for MVP (no unit tests required)
- ES6 modules working well without build tools

### Tech Stack and Constraints

[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Frontend**: Vanilla JS with no framework - maximum simplicity
- **UI Enhancement**: Alpine.js 3.x for declarative reactivity (15KB, no build)
- **UI Components**: Native Web Components for reusable components
- **CSS Framework**: Tailwind CSS 3.4+ via CDN - no build required
- **Build Tool**: None - direct file serving with ES6 modules
- **Performance**: Page load target < 3s on 3G connection

### Navigation Architecture

[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#routing]
**Route Organization:**
- `/` (index.html) - Homepage with hero and featured products
- `/shop.html` - Product catalog with filters
- `/product.html?id={productId}` - Individual product page
- `/cart.html` - Shopping cart
- `/checkout.html` - Checkout flow
- `/account.html` - User account dashboard
- `/admin/` - Admin section (protected)

### State Management for Navigation

[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#state-management]
```javascript
// Use existing user store for auth state
Alpine.store('user', {
  isAuthenticated: false,
  uid: null,
  email: null,
  displayName: null,
  role: 'customer',
  // Methods for auth state already implemented
});
```

### Component Specifications

**Navigation Web Component Pattern** [Source: architecture/components.md#web-components]:
```javascript
class SiteNavigation extends HTMLElement {
  constructor() {
    super();
    this.attachShadow({ mode: 'open' });
  }
  connectedCallback() {
    // Component initialization
    // Listen to Alpine store changes
    // Render navigation based on auth state
  }
}
customElements.define('site-navigation', SiteNavigation);
```

### Protected Route Pattern

[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#protected-routes]
For admin navigation links:
```javascript
class AuthGuard {
  static async checkAccess(requiredRole = 'customer') {
    // Implementation already exists
    // Use for protecting admin navigation items
  }
}
```

### Analytics Integration

[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#analytics]
Track navigation and CTA interactions:
```javascript
// Use existing analytics service
analyticsService.trackEvent('cta_click', {
  cta_location: 'hero',
  cta_text: 'Shop Now',
  destination: '/shop.html'
});
```

### Performance Optimization

[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#performance]
```javascript
// Lazy load non-critical modules
if (userIsAuthenticated) {
  import('./modules/user-features.js').then(module => {
    module.initialize();
  });
}
```

### Missing Architecture Guidance

The following items have no specific guidance in architecture docs:
- Specific navigation menu structure or categories beyond what's in the epic
- Mobile navigation pattern (hamburger menu implementation details)
- Hero section design specifications
- Educational content structure
- SEO meta tags requirements (beyond basic implementation)

## Testing

### Test Standards

[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#frontend-testing]
- **Test Location**: Manual test checklists in `/docs/testing/`
- **Test Framework**: Manual testing only for MVP (no Jest/Cypress)
- **Browser Testing**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari (mobile and desktop)
- **Performance**: Page load < 3s on 3G
- **Accessibility**: Screen reader testing required
- **Device Testing**: Responsive design across all common breakpoints
