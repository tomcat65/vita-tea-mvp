## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

Story 1.1 established the Firebase project foundation. Key security findings to address:
- Proper error handling patterns must be implemented
- Security rules need careful testing
- API keys should be loaded from environment configuration
- CORS should be configured for specific domains only

### Authentication Architecture

[Source: architecture/security-and-performance.md]

**Security Functions:**
```javascript
// Authentication check
function isSignedIn() {
  return request.auth != null;
}

// User ownership validation
function isOwner(userId) {
  return request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
}
```

**Rate Limiting:**
- Implement 1 second minimum between writes
- Consider rate limiting authentication attempts

### User Data Model

[Source: architecture/data-models.md]

```typescript
interface User {
  uid: string;              // Firebase Auth UID
  email: string;            
  displayName: string;      
  role: 'customer' | 'admin';
  createdAt: Timestamp;
  updatedAt: Timestamp;
  lastLoginAt: Timestamp;
  preferences: {
    marketingEmails: boolean;
    orderNotifications: boolean;
  };
}
```

### Frontend Implementation

[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md]

**State Management:**
- Use Alpine.js for reactive user state
- Implement AuthGuard pattern for protected routes
- Support guest cart merging after login

**Project Structure:**
```
public/
├── js/
│   ├── auth.js           # Authentication logic
│   ├── auth-guard.js     # Route protection
│   └── services/
│       └── auth-service.js # Firebase Auth wrapper
├── login.html
├── register.html
└── reset-password.html
```

### Error Handling

[Source: architecture/error-handling-strategy.md]

**Auth Error Messages:**
```javascript
const authErrors = {
  'auth/user-not-found': 'No account found with this email',
  'auth/wrong-password': 'Incorrect password', 
  'auth/email-already-in-use': 'An account already exists with this email',
  'auth/weak-password': 'Password should be at least 6 characters',
  'auth/invalid-email': 'Please enter a valid email address'
};
```

### Security Requirements

[Source: architecture/security-and-performance.md]

1. **Firestore Rules**: Restrict user document access to authenticated owners
2. **Password Requirements**: Minimum 6 characters (Firebase default)
3. **Session Management**: Use Firebase Auth state persistence
4. **HTTPS Only**: All authentication happens over secure connections
5. **Security Headers**: Implement recommended security headers

### Mobile Optimization

[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md]

1. **Touch Targets**: Minimum 44x44px for all interactive elements
2. **Form Design**: Single column layout for mobile
3. **Keyboard Behavior**: Proper input types for email/password
4. **Loading States**: Clear visual feedback during auth operations
5. **Error Display**: Toast notifications for mobile-friendly errors

### Testing Requirements

[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

1. **Unit Tests**: Test auth service functions
2. **Integration Tests**: Test full auth flows with emulator
3. **Security Tests**: Verify Firestore rules enforcement
4. **Manual Tests**: Test social login flows on real devices
5. **Performance Tests**: Ensure auth operations complete under 2 seconds

### Technical Constraints

- Must work within Firebase free tier limits
- No custom backend - use Firebase Auth directly
- shadcn/ui via CDN (no build process)
- Support latest 2 versions of major browsers
- Progressive enhancement for older browsers

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-08-26

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

The authentication implementation provides a functional foundation with proper Firebase Auth integration across multiple providers. The code demonstrates good separation of concerns and follows many ES6+ best practices. However, several critical security vulnerabilities and standards compliance issues require immediate attention before production deployment.

### Refactoring Performed

Due to the critical security issues identified, I recommend addressing these through targeted fixes rather than broad refactoring at this stage:

- **File**: public/js/auth.js
  - **Change**: Replace innerHTML with secure DOM manipulation
  - **Why**: Critical XSS vulnerability when displaying user data
  - **How**: Use textContent or createElement to prevent script injection

- **File**: public/js/auth-guard.js  
  - **Change**: Replace email-based admin check with Firebase custom claims
  - **Why**: Current implementation easily spoofable via email
  - **How**: Use getIdTokenResult() to verify admin claims

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✗ File naming convention violated (auth-service.js should be auth.service.js), missing JSDoc documentation
- Project Structure: ✓ Proper separation of services, guards, and UI components
- Testing Strategy: ✗ Tests exist but don't run due to configuration issues, missing OAuth and integration tests
- All ACs Met: ✓ All 6 acceptance criteria technically implemented

### Improvements Checklist

- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Fix XSS vulnerability in auth.js by using secure DOM methods
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Implement proper admin validation using Firebase custom claims
- [ ] **HIGH**: Add client-side rate limiting for authentication attempts
- [ ] **HIGH**: Implement CSRF protection for state-changing operations
- [ ] **HIGH**: Fix test configuration to enable test execution
- [ ] **MEDIUM**: Implement shadcn/ui components as required (currently using raw Tailwind)
- [ ] **MEDIUM**: Add comprehensive JSDoc documentation to all functions
- [ ] **MEDIUM**: Rename auth-service.js to auth.service.js per naming standards
- [ ] **MEDIUM**: Implement password complexity requirements beyond 6 characters
- [ ] **LOW**: Add OAuth provider tests (Google, Apple sign-in)
- [ ] **LOW**: Implement memory leak prevention for auth state listeners
- [ ] **LOW**: Add performance monitoring for auth operations

### Security Review

**Critical Issues Found:**
1. **XSS Vulnerability**: User displayName directly injected into innerHTML
2. **Weak Admin Validation**: Email domain check instead of secure claims
3. **Missing Rate Limiting**: No client-side protection against brute force
4. **No CSRF Protection**: Despite being mentioned in tasks as completed

**Security Strengths:**
- Proper use of Firebase Auth with multiple providers
- Email verification requirement implemented
- Generic error messages prevent user enumeration
- Secure session persistence configuration

### Performance Considerations

- **Issue**: Firebase SDK and UI libraries loaded from CDN on each page (no caching strategy)
- **Issue**: No lazy loading for authentication components
- **Issue**: Missing performance metrics for "auth operations under 2 seconds" requirement
- **Recommendation**: Implement service worker caching for SDK files
- **Recommendation**: Add performance.mark() calls to measure auth operation timing

### Files Modified During Review

No files were modified during this review. All recommendations are documented above for the development team to implement.

### Gate Status

Gate: **FAIL** → docs/qa/gates/1.2-customer-authentication-system.yml
- Critical security vulnerabilities (XSS, weak admin validation) must be addressed
- Tests don't execute due to configuration issues
- UI components don't match requirements (shadcn/ui not implemented)

### Recommended Status

✗ **Changes Required** - Critical security issues must be fixed before this story can be considered done. See unchecked items above, prioritizing CRITICAL and HIGH severity issues.
