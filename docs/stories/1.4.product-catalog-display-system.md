## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

From Story 1.3 implementation:
- Product collection schema is already defined with all required fields
- Security rules allow public read access for active products: `.where('isActive', '==', true)`
- Analytics collection is set up for tracking product views and interactions
- Use Firestore server timestamps for all time fields

### Data Models

**Product Interface** [Source: architecture/data-models.md#product-interface]:
```typescript
interface Product {
  productId: string;
  name: string;
  slug: string;
  description: string;
  category: 'digestive' | 'stress-relief' | 'immunity';
  price: number; // in cents
  images: string[];
  inventory: number;
  isActive: boolean;
  metadata: {
    ingredients: string[];
    brewingInstructions: string;
    healthBenefits: string[];
    caffeineLevel: 'none' | 'low' | 'medium' | 'high';
  };
  createdAt: Timestamp;
  updatedAt: Timestamp;
}
```

### API Specifications

**Firebase Service Methods** [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#firebase-service]:
```javascript
// In firebase-service.js
async getProducts(category = null) {
  let query = this.db.collection('products')
    .where('isActive', '==', true);
  if (category) {
    query = query.where('category', '==', category);
  }
  return query.get().then(snapshot => 
    snapshot.docs.map(doc => ({ id: doc.id, ...doc.data() }))
  );
}

async getProductById(productId) {
  return this.db.collection('products')
    .doc(productId)
    .get()
    .then(doc => doc.exists ? { id: doc.id, ...doc.data() } : null);
}
```

### Component Specifications

**Product Card Web Component** [Source: architecture/components.md#web-components]:
- Location: `/public/js/components/product-card.js`
- Use Shadow DOM for style encapsulation
- Dispatch custom events: `add-to-cart`, `view-product`
- Attributes: `product-id`, `product-data` (JSON string)
- Example structure provided in components.md

**State Management with Alpine.js** [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#state-management]:
```javascript
// Product catalog state
Alpine.store('products', {
  items: [],
  loading: false,
  currentCategory: null,
  async loadProducts(category = null) {
    this.loading = true;
    this.items = await firebaseService.getProducts(category);
    this.loading = false;
  }
});
```

### Testing Requirements

[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#frontend-testing]
- Unit tests not required for MVP phase (architecture states focus on manual testing)
- Use browser DevTools for component testing
- Test across Chrome, Firefox, Safari (mobile and desktop)
- Performance testing: Page load < 3s on 3G
- Accessibility testing with screen readers

### Technical Constraints

- No build tools or bundlers - use ES6 modules directly
- Tailwind CSS via CDN only (no custom build)
- Web Components for reusable UI elements
- Alpine.js (15KB) for reactive state management
- All financial values stored as integers (cents)
- Product images served from Cloud Storage with CDN

## Testing

### Test Standards
- Manual testing focus for MVP (no Jest/Cypress required)
- Browser compatibility testing required
- Performance metrics monitoring
- Accessibility compliance checks
- SEO validation tools usage

### Completion Notes List

1. **Product Catalog Page (shop.html)**: Implemented with responsive grid layout, category filtering, loading states, and empty states. Uses Alpine.js for state management as specified in architecture.

2. **Product Card Web Component**: Created with Shadow DOM encapsulation, displays all required product information, handles inventory states, and dispatches custom events for cart and view actions.

3. **Product Detail Page (product.html)**: Displays full product information with tabbed interface for ingredients, benefits, and brewing instructions. Includes organic certification badge and all metadata fields.

4. **Firebase Integration**: Created firebase.service.js with product fetching methods, real-time subscriptions, caching strategy, and offline support. Service follows singleton pattern.

5. **SEO Optimizations**: Added semantic HTML5 elements, dynamic meta tags, Open Graph tags, JSON-LD structured data generation, and XML sitemap. All pages are optimized for search engines.

6. **Analytics Tracking**: Implemented comprehensive analytics service that tracks page views, product interactions, scroll depth, and e-commerce events. Uses batch processing for performance.

7. **Testing**: Created manual test checklist as per MVP requirements (no unit tests needed per architecture). Checklist covers all acceptance criteria and cross-browser compatibility.

8. **Analytics Fix**: Resolved analytics write permission issue by implementing a Cloud Function endpoint (`trackAnalytics`) that accepts batched events from the client and writes them to Firestore with proper permissions.

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-08-27

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

The implementation demonstrates excellent code quality with clean, well-structured ES6 modules following project standards. The architecture properly separates concerns with dedicated services, components, and utilities. Web Components implementation with Shadow DOM provides proper encapsulation. Alpine.js state management is used effectively. Error handling is comprehensive throughout the codebase.

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: `/public/js/app.js`
  - **Change**: Added export statement for `initializeApp` function
  - **Why**: Both shop.html and product.html attempted to import this function but it wasn't exported
  - **How**: Prevents module import errors and ensures proper initialization across pages

- **File**: `/public/js/services/analytics.service.js`
  - **Change**: Added documentation comment about write permission issue
  - **Why**: Firestore security rules only allow Cloud Functions to write to analytics collection
  - **How**: Alerts developers to the issue and provides clear fix options

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ ES6+ features, proper naming conventions, JSDoc comments
- Project Structure: ✓ Files in correct directories per unified-project-structure.md
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Manual test checklist provided as specified for MVP
- All ACs Met: ✓ All 6 acceptance criteria fully implemented

### Improvements Checklist

- [x] Fixed missing app.js export for initializeApp function
- [x] Added documentation about analytics write permission issue
- [ ] Update firestore.rules to allow authenticated analytics writes OR implement Cloud Function
- [ ] Add skip navigation links for improved accessibility
- [ ] Consider service worker for offline product browsing
- [ ] Add input sanitization for defense in depth (low priority - admin-only writes)

### Security Review

No critical security issues found. Implementation properly escapes user data, validates URL parameters, and uses Firestore security rules to restrict product modifications to admins only. Analytics write permission needs adjustment but poses no security risk.

### Performance Considerations

Performance implementation is solid with lazy loading for images, 5-minute cache for product data, batch processing for analytics events (though currently failing), and debounced scroll tracking. Page load targets are achievable with current implementation.

### Files Modified During Review

- `/public/js/app.js` - Added export for initializeApp
- `/public/js/services/analytics.service.js` - Added documentation comment

### Gate Status

Gate: CONCERNS → docs/qa/gates/1.4-product-catalog-display-system.yml

### Recommended Status

✗ Changes Required - Analytics write permissions must be fixed for tracking to function. After addressing this issue, story will be ready for Done status. All other aspects of implementation are excellent.

## Post-QA Fix

### Fix Date: 2025-08-27
### Fixed By: James (Dev Agent)

### Issue Resolution

**Analytics Write Permissions Fix:**
- Implemented Cloud Function endpoint `trackAnalytics` to handle analytics writes
- Updated client-side analytics service to send events to Cloud Function via HTTPS
- Function deployed successfully to `https://us-central1-vida-tea.cloudfunctions.net/trackAnalytics`
- Client now batches events and sends them to the function which has proper Firestore write permissions
- Added CORS support for both production and local development environments

### Final Status

✓ All issues resolved. Story is now complete and ready for Done status.
