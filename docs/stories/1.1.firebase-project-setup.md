## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
No previous story - this is the foundation story.

### Technology Stack
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+), no framework
- **Backend**: TypeScript with Firebase Functions 4.9+
- **Database**: Firestore (latest)
- **Authentication**: Firebase Auth (latest)
- **Hosting**: Firebase Hosting
- **Build Tool**: None - direct file serving
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions with Firebase CLI 13.0+
- **IaC**: Firebase CLI with firebase.json configuration

### Project Structure Requirements

```

### Environment Configuration
[Source: architecture/deployment-architecture.md]
- Development, staging, and production environments required
- Environment-specific Firebase configurations needed
- GitHub Actions deployment pipeline with proper secret management

### File Locations
- Firebase configuration files in project root
- Static files in public/ directory following structure
- Cloud Functions in functions/ directory
- GitHub workflow in .github/workflows/deploy.yml

### Technical Constraints
- Firebase CLI version 13.0+ required
- TypeScript 5.3+ for Cloud Functions
- No build process - direct file serving
- ES6 modules for JavaScript organization

### Testing
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- Manual testing initially for MVP
- Firebase emulator for critical paths testing
- Pre-deploy testing checklist required
- GitHub Actions should include basic validation

### Quality Assessment

**Story Analysis:**
- **Requirements Traceability:** ✅ PASS - All acceptance criteria are clearly defined and measurable
- **Technical Guidance:** ✅ PASS - Comprehensive technical details with architecture references
- **Risk Assessment:** ⚠️ MEDIUM - Infrastructure setup with security and operational considerations
- **Test Coverage:** ⚠️ CONCERNS - Limited testing strategy for infrastructure validation

**Key Findings:**
1. **Strengths:**
   - Well-structured story with clear acceptance criteria
   - Comprehensive technical guidance from architecture documents
   - Proper multi-environment setup approach
   - Good CI/CD pipeline integration

2. **Areas of Concern:**
   - Security hardening procedures not explicitly defined
   - Infrastructure testing approach could be more robust
   - Disaster recovery procedures need documentation

3. **Recommendations:**
   - Add Firebase security rules validation checklist
   - Define specific tests for domain/SSL verification
   - Document backup and restoration procedures
   - Consider adding infrastructure monitoring setup
