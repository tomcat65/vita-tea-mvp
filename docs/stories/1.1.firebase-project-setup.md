### Environment Configuration

[Source: architecture/deployment-architecture.md]

- Development, staging, and production environments required
- Environment-specific Firebase configurations needed
- GitHub Actions deployment pipeline with proper secret management

### File Locations

- Firebase configuration files in project root
- Static files in public/ directory following structure
- Cloud Functions in functions/ directory
- GitHub workflow in .github/workflows/deploy.yml

### Technical Constraints

- Firebase CLI version 13.0+ required
- TypeScript 5.3+ for Cloud Functions
- No build process - direct file serving
- ES6 modules for JavaScript organization

### Testing

[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

- Manual testing initially for MVP
- Firebase emulator for critical paths testing
- Pre-deploy testing checklist required
- GitHub Actions should include basic validation

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-08-26

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Quality Assessment

**Story Analysis:**

- **Requirements Traceability:** ✅ PASS - All acceptance criteria are clearly defined and measurable
- **Technical Guidance:** ✅ PASS - Comprehensive technical details with architecture references
- **Risk Assessment:** ⚠️ MEDIUM - Infrastructure setup with security and operational considerations
- **Test Coverage:** ⚠️ CONCERNS - Limited testing strategy for infrastructure validation

**Key Findings:**

1. **Strengths:**
   - Well-structured story with clear acceptance criteria
   - Comprehensive technical guidance from architecture documents
   - Proper multi-environment setup approach
   - Good CI/CD pipeline integration

2. **Areas of Concern:**
   - Security hardening procedures not explicitly defined
   - Infrastructure testing approach could be more robust
   - Disaster recovery procedures need documentation

3. **Recommendations:**
   - Add Firebase security rules validation checklist
   - Define specific tests for domain/SSL verification
   - Document backup and restoration procedures
   - Consider adding infrastructure monitoring setup

### Gate Status

Gate: CONCERNS → docs/qa/gates/1.1-firebase-project-setup.yml

### Review Date: 2025-08-26

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

The implementation demonstrates functional infrastructure setup with all acceptance criteria technically met. However, several critical security vulnerabilities and code quality issues require immediate attention before production deployment.

### Refactoring Performed

No refactoring performed as this is an infrastructure setup story. Issues identified require architectural decisions and security policy changes rather than simple refactoring.

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✗ Missing JSDoc, error handling patterns not followed
- Project Structure: ✓ Follows unified project structure requirements
- Testing Strategy: ✗ No tests implemented despite strategy requirements
- All ACs Met: ✓ All acceptance criteria technically implemented

### Improvements Checklist

**Critical Security Issues (Must Fix):**

- [ ] Remove hardcoded Firebase API keys from firebase-config.js fallback (lines 19-27)
- [ ] Fix service account key exposure in deploy.yml (line 117) - use built-in auth
- [ ] Restrict products collection write access to admin users only (firestore.rules:6-7)
- [ ] Remove .env file from repository if it exists
- [ ] Implement proper CORS configuration instead of wildcard origins

**High Priority Issues:**

- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling to firebase-config.js
- [ ] Implement input validation in Firestore security rules
- [ ] Add security headers configuration to firebase.json
- [ ] Implement rate limiting for Cloud Functions
- [ ] Add environment-specific configuration management

**Code Quality Improvements:**

- [ ] Add JSDoc documentation to all JavaScript files
- [ ] Implement proper async initialization pattern
- [ ] Add TypeScript for client-side code
- [ ] Extract magic strings to configuration constants
- [ ] Add structured logging instead of console.error

**Testing Requirements:**

- [ ] Create unit tests for Cloud Functions
- [ ] Add integration tests for security rules
- [ ] Implement Firebase emulator test suite
- [ ] Add CI/CD test validation steps
- [ ] Create security rule test scenarios

### Security Review

**Critical Findings:**

1. **API Key Management**: Hardcoded Firebase config in multiple locations reduces security flexibility
2. **Service Account Exposure**: CI/CD writes service account to file (potential leak vector)
3. **Overly Permissive Rules**: Any authenticated user can modify products collection
4. **Missing Validation**: No data structure validation in security rules
5. **CORS Wildcard**: Allows requests from any origin (security risk)

**Recommendations:**

- Implement secure configuration management
- Use Firebase GitHub Action's native authentication
- Restrict write permissions to admin roles
- Add comprehensive rule validation
- Configure specific allowed origins

### Performance Considerations

1. **Config Loading**: Synchronous fallback blocks app initialization
2. **Missing Indexes**: Limited Firestore composite indexes defined
3. **No CDN Rules**: Static assets lack proper caching configuration
4. **API Caching**: Only config endpoint has cache headers

**Optimizations Needed:**

- Implement async initialization flow
- Define indexes for common query patterns
- Configure CDN caching rules
- Add cache headers to all endpoints

### Files Modified During Review

None - Issues identified require architectural decisions before modification.

### Gate Status

Gate: FAIL → docs/qa/gates/1.1-firebase-project-setup.yml
Risk profile: High security risk due to exposed credentials and overly permissive rules
NFR assessment: Security and reliability concerns require immediate attention

### Recommended Status

✗ Changes Required - Critical security issues must be addressed before production deployment
