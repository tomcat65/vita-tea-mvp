## User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision
Modern, wellness-focused ecommerce experience emphasizing educational content and premium positioning. Clean, trustworthy design that builds confidence in functional health benefits while maintaining accessibility for health-conscious consumers aged 25-55. The interface should feel like a premium tea shop with knowledgeable staff rather than a generic ecommerce platform.

### Key Interaction Paradigms
- **Educational-first browsing**: Product discovery through health benefits and ingredient education rather than traditional category filtering
- **Gentle guidance approach**: Optional AI assistance that appears contextually without overwhelming users who prefer traditional browsing
- **Trust-building interactions**: Transparent ingredient sourcing, organic certifications, and scientific backing prominently displayed
- **Seamless mobile commerce**: Touch-optimized checkout with digital wallet integration for quick mobile purchases

### Core Screens and Views
- **Dual-Entry Homepage**: Traditional navigation (Shop by Type/Benefit/Gift) with optional "Meet our tea experts" AI guidance entry point
- **Product Detail Pages**: Rich ingredient information, health benefits, brewing instructions, and educational content
- **Shopping Cart & Checkout**: Streamlined flow with guest checkout option and digital wallet integration
- **Customer Dashboard**: Order history, preferences, and personalized recommendations
- **Educational Content Hub**: Brewing guides, ingredient benefits, and wellness articles

### Accessibility: WCAG AA
Target WCAG AA compliance to ensure inclusive experience for users with disabilities, supporting screen readers, keyboard navigation, and color contrast requirements for health-conscious demographic.

### Branding
Premium wellness aesthetic combining clean modern design with natural, organic elements. Warm earth tones and botanical imagery that convey trust, quality, and health benefits. Typography should be highly readable with clear hierarchy supporting educational content consumption.

### Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive
Mobile-first responsive design optimizing for iPhone/Android browsing and purchasing, with enhanced desktop experience for educational content consumption. Progressive web app capabilities for improved mobile performance.

## Technical Assumptions

### Repository Structure: Monorepo
Single Firebase project repository containing frontend React application, Firebase Functions backend services, and shared configuration. Separate environments (dev/staging/prod) within unified codebase for streamlined deployment and maintenance.

### Service Architecture
**Serverless Microservices within Firebase Ecosystem**: Firebase Functions handle payment processing, inventory management, and order fulfillment as discrete serverless functions. Frontend React application connects to Firestore for real-time data synchronization and Firebase Authentication for user management.

**Risk Mitigation**: Firebase Premium Support tier established before launch, comprehensive monitoring for quota limits, and documented rollback procedures to Shopify if complexity outweighs benefits.

### Testing Requirements
**Unit + Integration Testing**: Jest unit tests for React components and Firebase Functions, Cypress integration testing for critical ecommerce flows (checkout, authentication, order processing). Manual testing protocols for payment processing and order fulfillment workflows.

**Enhanced Testing**: Load testing for Black Friday scenarios, Firestore transaction testing for inventory concurrency, and webhook reliability testing for payment processing edge cases.

### Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests

**Frontend Technology Stack:**
- **React 18** with TypeScript for type safety and developer experience
- **Next.js** with Static Site Generation for SEO optimization and Firebase Hosting routing optimization
- **shadcn/ui** component library for consistent design system implementation

**Third-Party Integrations:**
- **Stripe** with comprehensive webhook handling, failed payment retry logic, and chargeback workflows
- **Google Analytics 4** integrated with Firebase Analytics for comprehensive tracking
- **Mailchimp** API integration with rate limiting handling and GDPR-compliant sync protocols

**Risk Mitigation Strategies:**
- **Parallel Shopify Development**: Complete backup store setup during Firebase development as insurance policy
- **Knowledge Transfer Requirements**: All contractor work must include comprehensive documentation and internal team training
- **Compliance Framework**: FDA/FTC health claims compliance logging and content moderation tools implementation
- **Data Export Procedures**: Structured customer data export protocols for potential platform migration

**Development and Deployment:**
- **Firebase CLI** for local development and deployment automation
- **GitHub Actions** CI/CD pipeline with Firebase quota monitoring and automated alerts
- **ESLint + Prettier** for code quality and consistency standards
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Performance alerts, quota limit warnings, and business continuity dashboards

**Post-MVP Architectural Considerations:**
