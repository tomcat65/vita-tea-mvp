- **Redis:** Dual cache system (current + fallback knowledge)
- **Firebase:** User data, authentication, hosting
- **Pydantic AI:** Agent development framework
- **Queue Sync:** Seamless knowledge updates between conversation topics

## Brainstorming Session Results

**Techniques Used:** System Mapping, Constraint Analysis, Morphological Analysis
**Total Ideas Generated:** 15+ architectural components and strategies
**Session Duration:** 45+ minutes of structured ideation

### System Mapping - Knowledge Architecture Flow

**AI Agent Persona:** Mature, empathetic female herbalist specializing in ancient herbs and teas
**Primary Knowledge Sources (Firebase Collections):**
1. Herb Properties Database (effects, contraindications)
2. Cultural Origins & Traditional Uses  
3. Preparation Methods & Dosages
4. User Health Profile/Preferences

**Evolved Architecture Decision:** 
Moved from flat Firebase collections to graph + cache architecture:
- **Neo4j:** Deep relationship mapping (herb→effects→cultures→preparations→contraindications)
- **Redis:** Lightning-fast agent responses (cached herb combinations, user patterns)
- **Firebase:** User data, authentication, conversation history

### Research Ingestion Pipeline

**Evidence-Based Learning:** Scientific research only, no crowdsourced user reports
**Knowledge Sources:** PubMed, peer-reviewed journals, research databases
**Quality Gates:** Relevance scoring algorithm weighing:
- Content relevance (herb match, study type, traditional validation)
- Scientific quality (impact factor, methodology, sample size) 
- Practical application (safety data, dosages, cultural context)

### Constraint Analysis - Root Problem Solved

**Root Constraint Identified:** Knowledge Conflict Resolution
**Why Root:** Without resolving research conflicts, agents can't maintain consistent memory states, tracking becomes meaningless, and performance suffers from indecision loops

**Cascading Constraint Effects:**
- Knowledge conflicts → Memory consistency issues
- Memory consistency → Performance overhead
- Performance overhead → Response versioning complexity
- Response versioning → More knowledge conflicts exposed

### Morphological Analysis - Complete System Design

**Research Hierarchy Priority:**
1. **Sample Size** (larger studies preferred)
2. **Safety Data** (safety always overrides sample size)

**Conflict Resolution Logic:**
- Safety concerns always win over sample size
- Immediate knowledge updates for safety-critical information
- Fallback mode during conflict processing

**Agent Knowledge Sync Strategy:**
- **Queue Sync:** Agents finish current topic, then update before next topic
- **Dual Cache:** Always maintain current + fallback knowledge in Redis
- **Version Tracking:** Track which knowledge version informed each response

**Knowledge Update Flow:**
1. Continuous research ingestion & relevance scoring
2. Real-time Neo4j graph updates for high-scoring studies
3. Immediate Redis cache updates for safety-critical changes
4. Batch agent knowledge refresh with seamless transitions

### Implementation Architecture

**Phase 1: Knowledge Conflict Resolution Engine**
- Safety-first hierarchy algorithm
- Conflict detection and resolution
- Fallback recommendation systems

**Phase 2: Graph Database Design** 
- Neo4j schema for herbs, research, cultural data
- Relationship mapping between all knowledge domains
- Research citation and confidence scoring

**Phase 3: Dual Cache System**
- Redis current knowledge cache
- Redis safe fallback cache  
- Cache invalidation and sync strategies

**Phase 4: Continuous Learning Pipeline**
- Automated research monitoring
- Relevance scoring implementation
- Real-time knowledge graph updates

### Technical Constraints Resolved

**Memory Consistency:** Queue sync ensures agents complete topics before knowledge updates
**Knowledge Conflicts:** Safety-first hierarchy with immediate resolution  
**Performance Overhead:** Dual cache eliminates real-time conflict processing during conversations
**Response Versioning:** Full tracking of which knowledge version informed each response

### Agent Behavior Design

**During Normal Operations:**
- Access current knowledge from Redis cache
- Provide evidence-based recommendations with confidence levels
- Track knowledge version for each response

**During Conflict Processing:**
- Switch to fallback mode using established safe recommendations
- Avoid conflicted topics until resolution complete
- Maintain conversation flow without user disruption

**After Knowledge Updates:**
- Complete current conversation topic
- Sync new knowledge at natural conversation breaks
- Seamlessly transition to updated recommendations

### Safety & Regulatory Considerations

**Evidence Standards:** Only peer-reviewed scientific research
**Safety Hierarchy:** Safety data always overrides other factors
**Liability Protection:** Full audit trail of knowledge versions used
**User Protection:** Conservative fallback recommendations during conflicts
