# Introduction

This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for the Vita-Tea MVP - a Firebase-powered wellness tea e-commerce platform targeting rapid market entry with 50+ orders in month 1. 

The architecture prioritizes:
- **Speed to Market**: Firebase ecosystem for accelerated development
- **MVP Focus**: Pragmatic choices over perfect solutions
- **Scalability Path**: Foundation that supports future AI agent integration
- **Operational Excellence**: Built-in analytics for achieving 200+ orders by month 3
- **AI-Driven Development**: Optimized for Claude and other AI agents to implement

This unified fullstack approach ensures consistency across the entire technology stack while maintaining the flexibility to evolve from MVP to the advanced AI-powered platform envisioned in the business brief.
