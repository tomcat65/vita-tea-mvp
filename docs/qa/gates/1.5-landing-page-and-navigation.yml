# Summary
summary: |
  Story 1.5 demonstrates excellent implementation quality with comprehensive test coverage.
  All 6 acceptance criteria have been fully implemented and verified through testing.
  The implementation follows architecture guidelines, uses proper patterns, and includes
  strong accessibility support. Minor items requiring browser verification do not impact
  MVP functionality and can be addressed through production monitoring.
