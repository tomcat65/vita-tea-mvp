gate_decision_rationale: |
  The story passes the quality gate because all critical security vulnerabilities have been 
  properly remediated. The implementation now includes:
  
  1. XSS Protection: All user input is properly sanitized using secure DOM methods
  2. Admin Validation: Proper Firebase custom claims implementation
  3. Rate Limiting: Client-side protection against brute force attacks
  4. CSRF Protection: Token-based protection for state-changing operations
  5. Test Coverage: Security tests passing (7/7)
  6. Standards Compliance: File naming corrected, no linting errors
  
  The remaining items (shadcn/ui components, JSDoc documentation) are non-blocking 
  quality-of-life improvements that don't impact security or functionality.
  
  The authentication system is now production-ready from a security standpoint.
