recommendations:
  immediate:  # Should fix before production
    - action: 'Update firestore.rules to allow authenticated users to write analytics events OR implement Cloud Function endpoint'
      refs: ['firestore.rules:149-152']
      rationale: 'Analytics tracking is non-functional without this change'
  future:  # Can be addressed later
    - action: 'Add skip navigation links for accessibility'
      refs: ['shop.html', 'product.html']
      rationale: 'Improves keyboard navigation experience'
    - action: 'Consider implementing service worker for offline product browsing'
      refs: ['firebase.service.js']
      rationale: 'Would enhance offline user experience'
    - action: 'Add input sanitization for displayed product data'
      refs: ['product-card.js', 'product-detail.js']
      rationale: 'Defense in depth, though risk is low if only admins can write products'
